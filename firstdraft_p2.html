<div class="narrator"> It’s hard to pinpoint where it starts</div>
<div class="me"> I don’t know when it started</div>
<div class="me"> Maybe it was the bullying</div>
<div class="me"> Maybe it was my parents making me feel like whatever i did was never enough so i just stopped fucking trying</div>
<div></div>
<div class="parents"> You disgust me</div>
<div></div>
<div class="parents"> You’re never going to graduate</div>
<div></div>
<div class="parents"> What you do reflects not on you but the whole family</div>
<div></div>
<div class="parents"> Think of how disappointed everyone would be if they knew</div>
<div></div>
<div class="me"> It got worse</div>
<div class="me"> I stopped eating for the most part</div>
<div class="me"> I stayed up all night not being able to do anything but sit paralyzed by my own thoughts</div>
<div class="me">This was 7th grade</div>
<div class="me">8th grade is where i learned how to formulate my personality based on who i talked to and how much of myself i kept and how much i faked and fabricated.</div>
<div>C2:You know my daughter is your age and taking like 5 AP classes, she’s a straight A student, she just got her driver's licence and her first job</div>
<div class="me"> I sat through endless pointless sessions because i kept telling myself that i need to try to get something out of this because there is literally no other person taking new patients</div>
<div class="parents">Do you know expensive this is to send you to a counselor</div>
<div class="parents">Only half of it is covered by insurance</div>
<div class="me">After a year and a half i couldn’t deal with being compared to this psychologists daughter and feeling even shittier after each session</div>
<div class="me">My Junior year it got really really bad</div>
<div class="me">Panic attacks every few nights</div>
<div class="parents">Oh get over it</div>
<div class="parents">You’re fine</div>
<div class="parents">Stop faking it</div>
<div class="parents">Everyone has anxiety</div>
<div class="parents">Everyone is depressed sometimes</div>
<div class="suicide">I was 5 steps away from killing myself one night</div>
<div class="suicide">I sat in front of the laundry room crying looking at the container of bleach</div>
<div class="suicide">I cried in my room because i didn’t have the combination to the gun safe</div>
<div></div>
<div class="suicide">THE ONLY REASON I DIDN’T KILL MYSELF IS BECAUSE THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN EXISTING IS HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE IF IT DIDN’T WORK</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div class="narrator">And it never ends</div>
<div class="narrator">There is no cure</div>
<div class="narrator">You don’t magically wake up one day and you’re completely fine</div>
<div class="narrator">You can’t erase everything that’s happened</div>
<div class="narrator">Every thought</div>
<div class="narrator">All the noise</div>
<div class="narrator"> might not be as bad eventually</div>
<div class="narrator">But it’s still there</div>
<div class="narrator">Lingering</div>
<div class="narrator">Like a dim eeri exit sign at the end of a dark empty hall (zoom into flickering exit sign… starts slow and rapidly speeds up)</div>
<div class="narrator">Other times it’s in your face (exit sign super bright and overwhelming)</div>
<div class="narrator">It’s so loud it’s impossible to ignore</div>
<div class="narrator">And sometimes it takes over</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div class="narrator">But you can manage</div>
<div class="narrator"You can cover it up</div>
<div class="narrator">You can take those pills</div>
<div class="me">the pediatrician that I went to started doing routine depression checks</div>
<div class="me">It was a test out of 20. 1 being fine, 20 being OMIGOD HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE</div>
<div class="me">"I scored 17 only because i didn’t want to kill myself every waking moment just every couple days.</div>
<div class="me">Then i was prescribed the magic pills</div>
<div class="me">The pills that i thought would solve all of my problems</div>
<div class="me">The pills will make it all go away</div>
<div class="me">They did though</div>
<div class="me">They erased it all</div>
<div class="me">Turned me into a shell</div>
  <img src="zoloft1.gif">
<div></div>
<div class="me">2 months still nothing</div>
<div>*larger pills* doubled</div>
<div class="me">Things are “fine” for a little while</div>
<div>*super huge pills*</div>
<div class="me">Fine only lasts so long</div>
<div class="me">By the end of my senior year i was taking 125 mg</div>
<div class="narrator">Turns out fine was</div>
<div>Numb</div>
<div>Nothing</div>
<div>Empty</p>
<div>Numb</div>
<div class="me">What am i without depression</div>
<div>empty</div>
<div class="narrator">Feel numb if feeling everything is too much</div>
<div class="narrator">Talk shit out</div>
<div class="narrator">Go to endless counselor sessions</div>
<div class="narrator">Or don’t</div>
<div class="me">I stopped taking the pills</div>
<div class="me">I moved away</div>
<div class="me">Away from the only counselor out of many who i felt actually helped me</div>
<div class="me">Who listened</div>
<div class="me">Who didn’t compare me to her daughter who could do no wrong</div>
<div class="me">Once i was in california</div>
<div class="narrator">I had to be fine</div>
<div class="narrator">I had to deal without</div>
<div class="narrator">No pills</div>
<div class="narrator">No professionals</div>
<div class="narrator">Build protective walls</div>
<div class="narrator">Fabricated personalities</div>
<div class="narrator">To hide</div>
<div class="narrator">To cover up</div>
<div class="narrator">Anything to not let anyone see how broken you are</div>
<div class="me">Just like i had before</div>
<div class="me">In a way i felt like the emptiness from the pills never went away</div>
<div class="narrator">There seemed to be a switch that i could almost flip to go back to the nothingness in my head</div>
<div class="narrator">Give the illusion of fine</div>
<div class="me">For all intents and purposes i’m fine</div>
<div class="me">But i’m not cured of my depression</div>
<div class="narrator">There is no cure</div>
<div class="narrator">Just management</div>
<div class="narrator">A cover up</div>
<div class="narrator">An illusion of fine</div>
