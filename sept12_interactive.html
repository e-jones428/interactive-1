  If all our life is but a dream
  Fantastic posing greed
  Then we should feed our jewelery to the sea
  For diamonds do appear to be
  Just like broken glass to me
  And then she said she can't believe
  Genius only comes along
  In storms of fabled foreign tongues
  <p>Tripping eyes, and flooded lungs<br>
  Northern downpour sends its love</p>
  Hey moon, please forget to fall down
  Hey moon, don't you go down
  Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
  Weather-vanes my one and lonely
  The ink is running toward the page
  It's chasin' off the days
  Look back at both feet
  And that winding knee
  I missed your skin when you were east
  You clicked your heels and wished for me
  Through playful lips made of yarn
  That fragile Capricorn
  Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
  <p class="first"><em>I know the world's a broken bone <br>
  But melt your headaches, call it home</em></p>
  Hey moon, please forget to fall down
  Hey moon, don't you go down
  Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
  Weather-vanes my one and lonely
  Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
  Weather-vanes my one and lonely
  Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
  Weather-vanes my one and lonely
  Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
  Weather-vanes my one and lonely
  Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
  Weather-vanes my one and lonely
  Sugarcane (hey moon) in (hey moon)
  The easy (hey moon) mornin'
  Weather-vanes (hey moon) my (hey moon)
  One (hey moon) and lonely
  Hey moon, please forget to fall down
  Hey moon, don't you go down
  You are at the top of my lungs
  Drawn to the ones who never yawn
