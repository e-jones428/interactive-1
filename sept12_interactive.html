<p>It’s hard to pinpoint where it starts</p>
<p>I don’t know when it started</p>
<p>Maybe it was the bullying</p>
<p>Maybe it was my parents making me feel like whatever i did was never enough so i just stopped fucking trying</p>
<p>You disgust me</p>
<p>You’re never going to graduate</p>
<p>What you do reflects not on you but the whole family</p>
<p>Think of how disappointed everyone would be if they knew</p>
<p>It got worse</p>
<p>I stopped eating for the most part</p>
<p>I stayed up all night not being able to do anything but sit paralyzed by my own thoughts</p>
<p>This was 7th grade</p>
<p>8th grade is where i learned how to formulate my personality based on who i talked to and how much of myself i kept and how much i faked and fabricated.</p>
<p>C2:You know my daughter is your age and taking like 5 AP classes, she’s a straight A student, she just got her driver's licence and her first job</p>
<p>Me:I sat through endless pointless sessions because i kept telling myself that i need to try to get something out of this because there is literally no other person taking new patients</p>
<p>Mother:</p>
<p>Do you know expensive this is to send you to a counselor</p>
<p>Only half of it is covered by insurance</p>
<p>Me:After a year and a half i couldn’t deal with being compared to this phycologists daughter and feeling even shittier after each session</p>
<p>My Junior year it got really really bad</p>
<p>Panic attacks every few nights</p>
<p>Oh get over it</p>
<p>You’re fine</p>
<p>Stop faking it</p>
<p>Everyone has anxiety</p>
<p>Everyone is depressed sometimes</p>
<p>I was 5 steps away from killing myself one night</p>
<p>I sat in front of the laundry room crying looking at the container of bleach</p>
<p>I cried in my room because i didn’t have the combination to the gun safe</p>
<p>THE ONLY REASON I DIDN’T KILL MYSELF IS BECAUSE THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN EXISTING IS HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE IF IT DIDN’T WORK</p>
<p>And it never ends</p>
<p>There is no cure</p>
<p>You don’t magically wake up one day and you’re completely fine</p>
<p>You can’t erase everything that’s happened</p>
<p>Every thought</p>
<p>All the noise</p>
<p>It might not be as bad eventually</p>
<p>But it’s still there</p>
<p>Lingering</p>
<p>Like a dim eri exit sign at the end of a dark empty hall (zoom into flickering exit sign… starts slow and rapidly speeds up)</p>
<p>Other times it’s in your face (exit sign super bright and overwhelming)</p>
<p>It’s so loud it’s impossible to ignore</p>
<p>And sometimes it takes over</p>
<p>(black out)</p>
<p>But you can manage</p>
<p>You can cover it up</p>
<p>You can take those pills</p>
<p>the pediatrician that I went to started doing routine depression checks</p>
<p>It was a test out of 20. 1 being fine, 20 being OMIGOD HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE</p>
<p>I scored 17 only because i didn’t want to kill myself every waking moment just every couple days.</p>
<p>Then i was prescribed the magic pills</p>
<p>The pills that i thought would solve all of my problems</p>
<p>The pills will make it all go away</p>
<p>They did though</p>
<p>They erased it all</p>
<p>Turned me into a shell</p>
<p>*tiny pills* lowest dosage</p>
<p>2 months still nothing</p>
<p>*larger pills* doubled</p>
<p>Things are “fine” for a little while</p>
<p>*super huge pills*</p>
<p>Fine only lasts so long</p>
<p>By the end of my senior year i was taking 125 mg</p>
<p>Turns out fine was</p>
<p>Numb</p>
<p>Nothing</p>
<p>Empty</p>
<p>Numb</p>
<p>What am i without depression</p>
<p>empty</p>
<p>Feel numb if feeling everything is too much</p>
<p>Talk shit out</p>
<p>Go to endless counselor sessions</p>
<p>Or don’t</p>
<p>I stopped taking the pills</p>
<p>I moved away</p>
<p>Away from the only counselor out of many who i felt actually helped me</p>
<p>Who listened</p>
<p>Who didn’t compare me to her daughter who could do no wrong</p>
<p>Once i was in california</p>
<p>I was fine</p>
<p>I had to deal without</p>
<p>No pills</p>
<p>No professionals</p>
<p>Build protective walls</p>
<p>Fabricated personalities</p>
<p>To hide</p>
<p>To cover up</p>
<p>Anything to not let anyone see how broken you are</p>
<p>Just like i had before</p>
<p>In a way i felt like the emptiness from the pills never went away</p>
<p>There seemed to be a switch that i could almost flip to go back to the nothingness in my head</p>
<p>Give the illusion of fine</p>
<p>Now my younger sibling is going through something similar</p>
<p>Though what they are dealing with is more anxiety than mine ever was</p>
<p>I have to be there</p>
<p>I have to be fine when i’m not</p>
<p>I have to be cured for them</p>
<p>I have to pretend like it can go away</p>
<p>Maybe they can get more out of the system than i did</p>
<p>I have to pretend like it worked</p>
<p>Maybe they can deal better than i did</p>
<p>It kills me to think that they could feel like i did</p>
<p>To get as low as i did</p>
<p>To come so close</p>
<p>To save them</p>
<p>I play pretend</p>
<p>I fabricate</p>
<p>I cover up</p>
<p>So i’m not a burden</p>
<p>So they don’t worry</p>
<p>So they don’t feel like they wasted</p>
<p>their time</p>
<p>Their money</p>
<p>Their energy</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes i’m fine</p>
<p>But i’m not cured of my depression</p>
<p>There is no cure</p>
<p>Just management</p>
<p>A cover up</p>
<p>An illusion of fine</p>
